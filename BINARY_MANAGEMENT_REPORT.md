# Binary View Management Report

**Date**: 2025-07-02  
**Status**: Successfully tested binary switching

## Key Findings

### 1. Binary Switching Works! ✅
- The system successfully detected when you switched from `dottdemo.bsc6` to `/bin/ls`
- The Python executor automatically picks up the new binary view
- All helper functions work with the new binary

### 2. Current Capabilities

#### What Works:
- ✅ Automatic detection of binary switches in UI
- ✅ Binary view context updates automatically
- ✅ All Python commands work with new binary
- ✅ Function count updates (65 → 141 functions)
- ✅ File path tracking works correctly

#### Limitations:
- ❌ Cannot programmatically close binaries (no `close()` method)
- ❌ Cannot force UI to switch binaries from API
- ⚠️  HTTP `/load` endpoint has issues (needs fixing)
- ⚠️  One minor bug with `info()` function (being investigated)

### 3. How to Switch Binaries

**In Binary Ninja UI:**
1. **File → Open** - Load a new binary
2. **Tab switching** - Click tabs to switch between open binaries
3. **File → Recent Files** - Quick access to recent binaries

**The MCP server automatically tracks the active binary!**

### 4. API Behavior

When you switch binaries in the UI:
- The `bv` variable automatically updates
- All helper functions use the new binary
- Previous execution context is preserved
- The HTTP endpoints reflect the new binary

### 5. Test Results Summary

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Binary detection | ✅ | Correctly shows `/bin/ls` |
| Function count | ✅ | 141 functions (was 65) |
| File path | ✅ | Shows `/bin/ls` |
| Helper functions | ✅ | Work with new binary |
| Context updates | ✅ | Shows correct binary in responses |
| `info()` function | ❌ | Minor bug with size attribute |

### 6. Recommendations

1. **For Users:**
   - Simply switch binaries in Binary Ninja UI - MCP follows automatically
   - Use `info()` to check current binary (once fixed)
   - All Python commands work seamlessly with the active binary

2. **For Development:**
   - Fix the `/load` endpoint to use correct API
   - Fix the `info()` helper's size attribute
   - Consider adding `/binaries` endpoint to list all open views
   - Add session tracking for multiple binaries

## Example Usage

```python
# Check current binary
POST /console/execute
{"command": "bv.file.filename if bv else 'No binary'"}
# Returns: "/bin/ls"

# Count functions in new binary
POST /console/execute
{"command": "len(list(bv.functions))"}
# Returns: 141

# Search in new binary
POST /console/execute
{"command": "find_functions('main')"}
# Returns: Functions containing 'main' in /bin/ls
```

## Conclusion

Binary view management works well! The system automatically tracks the active binary in Binary Ninja's UI, and all Python execution happens in the context of that binary. This provides a seamless experience where users can switch binaries naturally in the UI while the MCP server follows along automatically.
